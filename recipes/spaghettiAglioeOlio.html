    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>No two aglio e olio recipes are alike, but this one is pretty true to the classic method.</p>
    <p>The key is slowly toasting the garlic slices to a perfect golden brown in the olive oil</p>
    <p>If it's too light, you don't get the full flavor and if it's too dark it gets bitter. My advice? Do it perfectly.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p>You likely already have most of the ingredients you'll need for this spaghetti aglio e olio recipe on hand. Here's what you'll need:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Spaghetti</strong>: This recipe, which makes about four servings, starts with one pound of uncooked spaghetti.</li>
      <li><strong>Oil</strong>: You'll need ½ cup of olive oil.</li>
      <li><strong>Garlic</strong>: Six cloves of thinly sliced garlic lends bold flavor.</li>
      <li><strong>Seasonings</strong>: This traditional spaghetti aglio e olio is flavored with crushed red pepper flakes, black pepper, and fresh parsley.</li>
      <li><strong>Cheese</strong>: For the most delicious results, grate your own Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese instead of opting for the pre-shredded stuff.</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
      <li>1 pound uncooked spaghetti</li>
      <li>½ cup olive oil</li>
      <li>6 cloves garlic, thinly sliced</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon red pepper flakes, or to taste</li>
      <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
      <li>¼ cup chopped fresh Italian parsley</li>
      <li>1 cup finely grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. <br>Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 10 to 12 minutes. <br>Drain and transfer to a pasta bowl.</li>
      <li>While the pasta is cooking, combine olive oil and garlic in a cold skillet. <br>Cook over medium heat to slowly toast garlic, about 10 minutes. <br>Reduce heat to medium-low when olive oil begins to bubble. <br>Cook and stir until garlic is golden brown, about another 5 minutes. <br>Remove from heat.</li>
      <li>Stir red pepper flakes, salt, and black pepper into pasta. <br>Pour in hot olive oil and garlic, and sprinkle on Italian parsley and half of the Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese; <br>toss until combined.</li>
      <li>Serve pasta topped with the remaining Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese.</li>
